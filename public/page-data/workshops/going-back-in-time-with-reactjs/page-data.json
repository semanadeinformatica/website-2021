As long as you register in this workshop.\nYou will learn how to handle timers, and leverage the Context API and hooks in React to provide all your components with an undoable-action creator,\nwhich they can use as needed. It will start as an introductory tech-talk about the main feature, to make you confortable with the code, and then we will explore different extra features which you can try to implement, with the instructor's help, for a more practical section.</p>\n<p>Although some context is given, this workshop is geared towards people with at least some basic knowledge of React.</p>","id":"05cbfac0-82d0-5962-95e1-8d27f8d6a07c","frontmatter":{"path":"/workshops/going-back-in-time-with-reactjs","title":"Going back in time with ReactJS","type":"Workshop","day":"11 novembro","place":"Online Room","start_time":"14h30","end_time":"17h30","registration":"https://www.eventbrite.pt/e/bilhetes-sinf-2020-workshop-going-back-in-time-with-reactjs-127549984437","speakers":[{"name":"Ângelo Teixeira","bio":"Ângelo is a MIEIC's finalist who, besides in his first year, has done internships every year between school years (who needs vacations, anyways?).
