Knowledge exchange across domains is fraught with challenges. This talk will explore example use cases and success stories of cross-disciplinary collaboration from our 7000+ global community of engineers, musicians, developers, makers, creators and innovators, and explore tools and methodologies which facilitate collaboration across domains. The presentation introduces the EU OntoCommons project for cross-domain industrial interoperability via ontology-driven data documentation for an Industry Commons.
