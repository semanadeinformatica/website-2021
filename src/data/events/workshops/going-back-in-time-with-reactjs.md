      - what: Estudante

    bio:
      Ângelo is a MIEIC's finalist who, besides in his first year, has done internships every year between school years (who needs vacations, anyways?). First at BLIP, then two times at Amazon in Madrid.
      His favorite area is Full Stack Development, with everything that it entails, from back-end APIs, databases... to UI, with a special focus on UX. He loves React and JavaScript, but probably that's because he doesn't know enough of it to hate it yet.

Don't you hate it when you accidentally click a button you didn't want to, and then your grandma receives an unwanted e-mail?
You'd wish for the website to have an Undo button to go back in time, or at least make it seem like it.

If you want to know how you could achieve that in a React application, you're in luck!... As long as you register in this workshop.
You will learn how to handle timers, and leverage the Context API and hooks in React to provide all your components with an undoable-action creator,
which they can use as needed. It will start as an introductory tech-talk about the main feature, to make you confortable with the code, and then we will explore different extra features which you can try to implement, with the instructor's help, for a more practical section.

Although some context is given, this workshop is geared towards people with at least some basic knowledge of React.
